NOTE: To make this succesful, logging instace should be set as unmanaged. To upgrade logging stack, backup configMap, set as managed and let stack be upgraded. Once upgraded set as unmanaged again and restore your custom configMap.

1. Edit configMap of fluentd as per fluentd-cm.yaml  
2. Delete all fluentd pods:
```
oc delete pod -l component=fluentd -n openshift-logging
```
3. Create new index based on the 'index_name .audit' from store directive.  
`Management -> Index Patterns -> Create Index Pattern -> Enter ".audit" in the Index Pattern. `
